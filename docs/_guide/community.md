There are many great resources and locations to learn about LitElement and web components,
share what you've built, and more. All community participation is subject to the Polymer Project's
<a href="https://github.com/Polymer/project/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a>—be
excellent to each other!

*   <strong>Join us on <a href="https://polymer-slack.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a>!</strong> 
    Polymer Slack has thousands of users discussing LitElement, web components, and related topics.
    Check out <code>#general</code>, <code>#beginners</code>, or
    <code>#tools</code> to get started.

*   Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/polymer">Twitter</a>
    for the latest on web components and the Polymer Project. Many
    of our team members can be found tweeting about LitElement, lit-html, 
    and the latest developments in the web platform.

*   The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/polymer-dev">polymer-dev</a>
    mailing list is great for long-form questions and discussion on any of the libraries, polyfills, or 
    standards the the Polymer Project works on.
